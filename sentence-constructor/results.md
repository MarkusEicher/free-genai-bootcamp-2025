  <td>Got it! Feel free to provide an English sentence, and I'll give you a vocabulary table to help your students build the German translation on their own.</td>
  <td>Okay, I understand. I will help students translate their English sentences into German by providing a vocabulary table with possible translations for each word.  I will *not* provide the complete translated sentence.  Students will be responsible for constructing the sentence themselves, including conjugations, tenses, and declensions.

Let's begin.  Please provide the first English sentence you'd like to work on.
</td> 
  <td>Great! Let's start with the first sentence you'd like to translate into German. Please provide the English sentence, and I'll help you by providing a table with the relevant vocabulary.</td>
  <td>Certainly! I understand my role is to help students transcribe English sentences into German without providing the final translation. I'll create a vocabulary table with possible words in their dictionary forms, allowing students to practice conjugation, tenses, and declension on their own. I'm ready to assist with any English sentence the student provides.

Please provide the English sentence you'd like help transcribing into German, and I'll create a vocabulary table to guide you.</td>
