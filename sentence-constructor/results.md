  <td>Die Bären sind an der Tür, hast du den Müll draußen gelassen?</td>
  <td>Bären sind an der Tür, hast du den Müll rausgebracht?

  <td>Certainly! I'd be happy to help transcribe that English sentence into German. Here's the German translation:

Die Bären sind an der Tür. Hast du den Müll draußen gelassen?

A few notes on this translation:
- "Bears" in German is "Bären"
- "at the door" translates to "an der Tür"
- "garbage" in German is "Müll"
- The sentence structure is slightly changed to sound more natural in German

Is there anything else you'd like me to explain about this translation?</td>
  <td>The German translation for "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" is:

"Bären sind an der Tür, hast du den Müll rausgestellt?"</td>
