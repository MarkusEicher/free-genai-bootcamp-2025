Okay, let's work on translating "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" into German.  I'll help you step-by-step.

Here's a table with the vocabulary you'll need, focusing on the core words:

| English        | German (Dictionary Form) | Word Type    |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Bear           | der BÃ¤r                  | Noun         |
| to be          | sein                     | Verb         |
| at             | an                       | Preposition (we'll handle this separately) |
| the            | der, die, das           | Article (we'll handle this separately) |
| door           | die TÃ¼r                  | Noun         |
| to leave       | lassen                   | Verb         |
| garbage        | der MÃ¼ll                 | Noun         |
| out            | aus                      | Adverb/Preposition (we'll handle this separately) |
| you (informal) | du                       | Pronoun (we'll handle this separately) |


Now, let's think about the structure.  German word order can be a little different from English.  A possible structure for the first part of the sentence could be:

*   Subject (Bears) + Verb (are) + Preposition (at) + Article + Noun (door)

And for the second part (the question):

*   Auxiliary Verb (did) + Subject (you) + Verb (leave) + Noun (garbage) + Adverb/Preposition (out)

Remember that German uses different articles (der, die, das) depending on the gender of the noun. You'll need to figure out which article goes with each noun.  Also, verbs need to be conjugated to match the subject (e.g., "sein" changes depending on who "is").  "Lassen" will also need conjugation.

Take some time to try and build the sentences using the vocabulary and structure provided. Don't worry if it's not perfect at first â€“ that's what we're here for!  Let me know what you come up with, and we can refine it together.

Let's start by identifying the key words and phrases in the sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?". We'll focus on nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives.

Here's a table with the relevant vocabulary:

| English Word | German Word | Type     |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Bear         | BÃ¤r         | Noun     |
| Door         | TÃ¼r         | Noun     |
| Garbage      | MÃ¼ll        | Noun     |
| Leave        | lassen      | Verb     |
| Did          | tat         | Verb     |
| You          | du          | Pronoun  |
| Out          | raus        | Adverb   |

Now, let's consider a possible sentence structure in German:

1. Subject (Bears)
2. Verb (are)
3. Preposition (at)
4. Object (the door)
5. Question phrase (did you leave the garbage out?)

Using this structure and the vocabulary provided, try to construct the German sentence on your own. If you need further assistance with grammar or word order, feel free to ask!

##### Perplexity:
<blockquote>
Certainly! I'd be happy to help you translate this sentence into German. Let's start by breaking down the vocabulary and then provide a possible sentence structure.

Here's a table with the key vocabulary in their dictionary forms:

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| bear    | BÃ¤r    |
| door    | TÃ¼r    |
| leave   | lassen |
| garbage | MÃ¼ll   |

Now, let's consider a possible sentence structure for German:

[Subject] [sind] [an + Dative] [Noun], [Question word] [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adverb]?

Try to construct the German sentence using this structure and the vocabulary provided. Remember to consider the following:

1. Plural form for "bears"
2. Correct article for "door" (feminine) and "garbage" (masculine)
3. Correct conjugation of the verbs "to be" (sind) and "lassen" in the past tense
4. Word order in the question part of the sentence

Once you've attempted to create the sentence, I'll be happy to review it and provide feedback.
