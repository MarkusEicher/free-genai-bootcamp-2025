Okay, let's work on translating "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" into German.  I'll guide you through the process.

First, let's break down the sentence and identify the parts of speech.

| English Word | German Word Type | Dictionary Form (Nominativ/Infinitiv) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bears | Noun | der BÃ¤r | Plural: die BÃ¤ren |
| are | Verb | sein |  |
| at | Preposition | an |  |
| the | Article | der, die, das | Depends on the noun's gender |
| door | Noun | die TÃ¼r |  |
| did you leave | Verb | lassen |  |
| the | Article | der, die, das | Depends on the noun's gender |
| garbage | Noun | der MÃ¼ll |  |
| out | Adverb | drauÃŸen |  |

**Possible Sentence Structures:**

*   Main Clause + Subordinate Clause (Question)
*   Main Clause + Coordinating Conjunction + Main Clause (Question)

Now, try to build the German sentence using the vocabulary and considering the sentence structure. Remember to think about word order, verb conjugation, and article declension.  Take your time and give it your best shot! I'm here to help if you get stuck.

**CEFR Level:** This sentence is likely around A2 level due to the use of a question with a separable verb ("lassen...aus").  If the student is below A2, we can simplify it.  For example, a simpler A1/A2 sentence might be: "Der BÃ¤r ist drauÃŸen." (The bear is outside.) or "Ist der MÃ¼ll drauÃŸen?" (Is the garbage outside?).
