## Folder containing homework for bootcamp preweek

There are two files in this folder. One is the PNG file and the RAG-System-Overview.md file contains the Mermaid version.

We decided to use Mermaid for all charting and visualization tasks, because it is a way to programmatically handle visualization without a big overhead of a framework or komplex tooling.
