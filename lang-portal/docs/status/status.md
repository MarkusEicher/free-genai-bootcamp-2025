### 2024-03-20 - Status Check
- Performed comprehensive status review
- Confirmed all systems and documentation are up to date
- Verified project structure adherence to monorepo standards
- All previous status entries remain accurate and current

Current Status: Project foundations solid, ready for implementation phase
Last Update: 2024-03-20

### 2024-03-20 - API Issues Identified
- Discovered duplicate API path issue (/api/v1/api/v1) in dashboard endpoint
- Identified continuous retry storm in frontend dashboard component
- Backend receiving excessive 404 requests
- Action plan created to address API configuration and retry logic

Current Status: API issues identified, requiring immediate attention to prevent system overload
Last Update: 2024-03-20

### 2024-03-20 - Investigation Update
- Attempted to analyze browser logs from docs/transfer
- Large log files require specialized analysis
- Need to investigate:
  1. Frontend API configuration files
  2. Dashboard component implementation
  3. API client setup
- Recommended next steps:
  1. Manual inspection of frontend API configuration
  2. Review of dashboard component's retry logic
  3. Backend route registration verification

Current Status: Investigation in progress, need direct access to frontend configuration
Last Update: 2024-03-20

### 2024-03-20 - Detailed API Analysis
- Root cause identified: Frontend API path concatenation issue
- Backend routes correctly configured but receiving malformed requests
- Rate limiting working as expected (60 req/min)
- Frontend retry logic needs improvement
- Action items:
  1. Fix frontend BASE_URL handling
  2. Implement proper retry backoff
  3. Review nginx proxy configuration

Current Status: Root cause identified, ready for implementation of fixes
Last Update: 2024-03-20

### 2024-03-20 - Browser Log Analysis
- Analyzed browser logs from docs/transfer
- Identified specific issues:
  1. Double slash in URL: /api/v1//api/v1/
  2. Resource exhaustion errors from excessive retries
  3. Error chain traced to DashboardLatestSessions component
- Component stack trace:
  1. DashboardLatestSessions.tsx -> dashboard.ts -> config.ts
  2. Using useCacheableQuery hook for data fetching
  3. Multiple retry attempts causing resource exhaustion

Current Status: Detailed error analysis complete, ready to fix URL construction and retry logic
Last Update: 2024-03-20

### 2024-03-20 - API URL Construction Fix
- Fixed URL construction in frontend/src/api/config.ts:
  1. Added check for existing BASE_URL in endpoints
  2. Prevented double base URL inclusion
  3. Improved path normalization
  4. Simplified sensitive parameter filtering
- Changes should resolve:
  1. Double slash issue (/api/v1//api/v1/)
  2. Duplicate base URL in requests
  3. Malformed API calls

Current Status: URL construction fixed, proceeding with retry logic improvements
Last Update: 2024-03-20

### 2024-03-20 - Retry Logic Implementation
- Implemented smart retry logic in useCacheableQuery hook:
  1. Added exponential backoff with configurable parameters
  2. Set sensible defaults (max 3 retries, 1-10s delay range)
  3. Added proper cleanup of retry timeouts
  4. Implemented retry count tracking
- Resource protection measures:
  1. Maximum retry limit
  2. Maximum delay cap
  3. Proper cleanup on component unmount
  4. State tracking for retry attempts

Current Status: Retry logic implemented with resource protection, ready for testing
